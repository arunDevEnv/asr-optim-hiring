Problem: The instance to solve is a problem to maximise the profit of the firm by using and selling machines.
The problem can be analysed as a network with source as the beginning of time period and sink as the last time period or the time period where restructuring ends.
From source, while moving forward in time, we encounter decisions of buy/sell or if not, using the existing machine for profit.
Maximise profit is the objective of the model and at each time period, there could be either one of the above mentioned decisions

Approach: Since the number of instances are less in number, a direct approach of enumerating all the possibilities and evaluating them can be done.
This approach ensures that all the relevant combinations are evaluated and thus the result obtained will be optimum.
For large sized problems, this approach may not be ideal as the number of calculations will increase since we are doing a one to one comparison for all the combinations.
Alternative method to suggest could be backward recursion approach in dynamic programming which could potentially execute faster.

Method to run the model: Copy instance.txt into the same folder as the model.pyz file and execute it by calling "python model.pyz"
